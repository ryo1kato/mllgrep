Todo list for stream (a.k.a. do-not-line-unline branch):

[x] ByteString.Lazy
[x] fgrep --count support (?)
[x] do-not-line-unline for regex keyword
[x] do-not-line-unline for --invert-match
[ ] O(n^2) issue probably perhaps because PCRE regex searches entire input, or BS.cat
[ ] do-not-line-unline + search-pattern-first for regex keyword
[ ] backward search limit to a Chunk or two, to free memory
[ ] minimal ByteStr.hs
